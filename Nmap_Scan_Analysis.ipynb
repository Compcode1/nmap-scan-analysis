    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "In this project, I explore **Nmap (Network Mapper)**, a powerful open-source network scanning tool used by cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and ethical hackers. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive **network reconnaissance scan**, analyze the discovered devices and services, and assess potential security implications.\n",
    "\n",
