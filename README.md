In this project, I explore **Nmap (Network Mapper)**, a powerful open-source network scanning tool used by cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and ethical hackers. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive **network reconnaissance scan**, analyze the discovered devices and services, and assess potential security implications.

### **Objectives of This Project**
By the end of this project, I will have:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Installed and used Nmap** to scan a local network.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Identified active devices**, their IP addresses, and open ports.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyzed running services and potential security risks** associated with open ports.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Understood how subnet scanning works** using CIDR notation.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Explored advanced scanning techniques** and how Nmap can be used for vulnerability detection and automation.

### **Why Is This Project Important?**
üîπ **Security Assessment:** Understanding which devices and services are exposed on a network is crucial for **identifying vulnerabilities**.  
üîπ **Penetration Testing Preparation:** Learning how attackers might perform reconnaissance helps in **hardening defenses**.  
üîπ **Practical Cybersecurity Experience:** Hands-on experience with **real-world tools like Nmap** strengthens network security skills.  
üîπ **Automated Network Monitoring:** Nmap can be used in **scripts to regularly monitor a network** for unexpected changes.

### **Scope of the Project**
This project will cover:
‚úî **A full subnet scan** (`192.168.1.0/24`) to identify all connected devices.  
‚úî **Analysis of open ports**, services, and potential vulnerabilities.  
‚úî **Security recommendations** based on findings.  
‚úî **Further exploration** of Nmap‚Äôs capabilities, including stealth scanning and automation with Python.
